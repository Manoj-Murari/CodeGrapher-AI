Of course. Documenting the journey is an excellent way to consolidate our learnings. Here is a summary of the development and debugging process for the CodeGrapher-AI project.

## CodeGrapher-AI: Development & Debugging Journey

This document chronicles the evolution of the CodeGrapher-AI project, from its initial architecture through a series of iterative debugging and enhancement cycles. It serves as a log of the challenges faced and the solutions implemented to build a robust, conversational AI for code analysis.

### ## 1. Laying the Foundation: Unit Testing

Our first major task after the initial setup was to build a robust testing foundation. This immediately uncovered our first challenge.

* **Symptom:** Running `pytest` resulted in a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'webtest'`.
* **Diagnosis:** We discovered that `pytest` was automatically trying to run the tests for the codebase we were analyzing inside the `target_repo` directory, which had its own separate dependencies.
* **Solution:** We configured `pytest` to explicitly ignore the `target_repo` directory by adding a `norecursedirs` setting to our `pyproject.toml` file. This isolated our application's tests from the target codebase.

### ## 2. Achieving Stateful Conversation

The next goal was to give the agent memory. While the initial implementation was straightforward, testing revealed a critical architectural flaw.

* **Symptom:** When asking the agent a follow-up question (e.g., "Based on the file you just showed me..."), it would fail. The logs showed the query was being incorrectly sent to the RAG engine.
* **Diagnosis:** The routing chain, which decides between `AGENT` and `RAG`, was **stateless**. It judged each query in isolation without any knowledge of the previous conversation, causing it to misclassify contextual follow-ups.
* **Solution:** This required a significant architectural change. We created a **single, shared memory object** in `engine/chain.py`. We then enhanced the router's prompt to include `chat_history` as an input and passed this shared memory to both the router and the agent. This made the entire system stateful and context-aware.

### ## 3. The Great Migration: Moving to LangGraph

To unlock more advanced capabilities, we migrated from a simple `AgentExecutor` to the more powerful `LangGraph` framework. This major upgrade introduced a series of complex debugging challenges.

#### **Problem: The Import Chase (Library Evolution)**
* **Symptom:** We encountered a cascade of `ImportError` and `ModuleNotFoundError` issues for core classes like `ToolExecutor`, `AgentAction`, and `AgentFinish`.
* **Diagnosis:** The `langchain` and `langgraph` libraries are evolving rapidly, and the import paths for many components had changed or were no longer public.
* **Solution:** We systematically debugged each import. For some (`AgentAction`), we found the new correct path in `langchain_core`. For others (`ToolExecutor`), the class was no longer reliably accessible. This led us to abandon the import entirely in favor of a more robust, self-implemented solution for tool execution within our graph.

#### **Problem: The Agent's Quirks (LLM Behavior)**
* **Symptom 1:** An `OutputParserException` occurred when the agent tried to answer a conversational question directly.
* **Diagnosis 1:** The LLM provided a correct, human-like answer but failed to format it with the required `Final Answer:` tag that the ReAct agent's parser expected.
* **Solution 1:** We made the `run_agent` node more resilient by wrapping the agent call in a `try...except OutputParserException` block. If a parsing error occurs, we now intelligently treat the raw, unformatted text as the intended final answer.

* **Symptom 2:** A `ValidationError` occurred when the agent tried to use the `query_code_graph` tool.
* **Diagnosis 2:** The LLM got confused by the tool's multiple arguments and bundled them into a single, malformed JSON string (e.g., `{"entity_name": "{\"entity_name\": \"save\", ...}"}`).
* **Solution 2:** We made the tool "smarter" by adding a robust input parser (`parse_tool_input`) that can detect and correct this specific malformation, ensuring the tool receives the arguments it expects.

#### **Problem: The Final Polish (Router Tuning)**
* **Symptom:** After all major bugs were fixed, we found that questions about code structure (e.g., "Who are the callers?") were *still* being misrouted to the RAG engine.
* **Diagnosis:** The router's prompt, while conversational, was not specific enough about the agent's new capabilities.
* **Solution:** We performed a final tuning of the prompt in `engine/chain.py`, adding an explicit clause to direct queries about **"callers" or "callees"** to the `AGENT`. This was the last fix required.

### ## Conclusion

This journey highlights the iterative nature of building complex AI systems. We successfully architected a dual-engine application, refactored it to a stateful graph, and systematically hardened it against library changes and unpredictable LLM behavior. The final result is a robust, capable, and well-architected conversational code analysis tool.
